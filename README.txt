Forsyth Malcolm Moler

A collection of procedures for numerical computation. Originally published in
"Computer Methods for Mathematical Computations" by George E. Forsythe,
Michael A. Malcolm, and Cleve B. Moler. Prentice-Hall, 1977.

Currently only the bisection optimizer is implemented, but I hope one day to
port all the subroutines. The bisection optimizer is actually credited to
Richard Brent in my source (http://www.pdas.com/programs/fmm.f90)

This software is Public Domain. Have fun. And if you feel like porting more of
the Fortran subroutines, share them back and I'll add them to the package.



INSTALLING:

This package is on pypi. Just do:

pip install FMM
